# dev-theme-for-chrome
A Chrome Extension to compliment KDr3w's "[Dev](https://www.deviantart.com/kdr3w/art/Dev-825722799)" Windows Theme

# Installation
1.) Download the files, extract them and then head over to your chromium based browser

2.) Put "chrome://extensions/" in the address bar and hit enter

3.) Enable developer options and click on "load unpacked"

4.) Now just select the folder you extracted your files to and load the extension

*Keep in mind that chrome automatically loads the extension from wherever you initially loaded it from, which means that you can't delete the folder you extracted it to*
